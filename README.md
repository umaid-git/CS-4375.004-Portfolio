# Summary
In my senior year at UTD I took a Machine Learning class. Through this class I have acquired valuable skills. I have learned about machine learning models like Linear Regression, Classification, Naive Bayes Model, kNN, kMeans and neural networks and when to use which model. I have learned on how to explore data and cleaned it so that a machine learning model can be made out of it. I have also learned how we can use C++ and Python libraries to do machine learning on datasets. Personally, my favorite project was Image Classification with deep learning in which which we have to create a machine learning model by training it with images and test the model to see if the model is able to predict the image.Machine Learning is a very interesting topic and is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. With the release of Chat-gpt, learning how these algorithms works have kind of become an essential for every programmer. I will continue to learn more about machine learning, especially in the area of computer vision.
