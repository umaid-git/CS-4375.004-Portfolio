Recreating some statistical function of R in C++ : [Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration](https://github.com/umaid-git/CS-4375.004-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Component%201%20Data%20Exploration/main.cpp)  
and the [output and a breif explanation of how it can help in data exploration](https://github.com/umaid-git/CS-4375.004-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Component%201%20Data%20Exploration/Portfolio%20Component%201%20Data%20Exploration.pdf)  

Demonstration of [Linear Regression](https://github.com/umaid-git/CS-4375.004-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) and [Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes](https://github.com/umaid-git/CS-4375.004-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf)  
  
Building A Linear Regression and Naive Bayes Model [from scratch in C++](https://github.com/umaid-git/CS-4375.004-Portfolio/tree/main/C%2B%2B%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch). These models were build with the help of fellow student Aleeza Athar
